    <h1> Creamy Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <h2> Here is the recipe to make Mac and Cheese:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li> 
        <p> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a pizza pan with aluminum foil; lay bacon strips on top.</p>

        <p>Bake bacon in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, about 15 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Drain bacon slices on paper towels and allow to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Place in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until crumbly.</p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Preheat a smoker to 275 to 300 degrees F (135 to 150 degrees C). Add wood chips according to manufacturer's directions.</p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>Mix together cream, Cheddar cheese, Colby-Jack cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, butter, and barbeque rub in the warm pasta pot; add drained macaroni. Mix well and let the cheese melt. Pour into a 9x13-inch aluminum pan and sprinkle bacon on top.</p>
        <li> Step 7</li>
        <p>Place the pan on the rack in the preheated smoker. Cook until cheese is bubbly, about 3 1/2 hours.</p>
